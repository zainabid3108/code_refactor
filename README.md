###############WHAT MAKES IT AMAZING CODE:-###################

Remove Unused Imports:
Check for any unused imports and remove them to keep the code clean.

Consistent Response Format:
Standardize the response format for all methods. You can create a helper method to handle the response format.

Reduce Redundant Code:

Minimize redundant code, especially in the distanceFeed method. You can simplify the logic by creating separate methods for different functionalities.
Dependency Injection:

Instead of directly accessing the config function, consider injecting the values through the constructor or using Laravel's configuration system.
Use Request Methods:

Take advantage of the request methods, such as input() and has(), to simplify your code.
Consistent Variable Naming:

Maintain consistent variable naming throughout the code.
Avoid Hardcoding:

Avoid hardcoding values like role IDs; consider using constants or configuration values.
Comments and Documentation:


Dependency Injection:
Instead of instantiating the Logger and MailerInterface directly in the constructor, consider injecting them through the constructor parameters. This allows for better flexibility and easier testing.

Use Dependency Injection in Controller Methods:
The getUsersJobsHistory method uses Request $request without injecting it. It's better to inject the Request object into the method parameters rather than accessing it globally.

Configurations:
Avoid using env() directly in the code. Instead, consider defining these values in configuration files and accessing them using the config() function.

Use Constants:
Instead of hardcoding values, use constants for values that are not expected to change during runtime.

Code Organization:
Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable functions. This improves code readability and maintainability.

Use Laravel's Eloquent Relationships:
Leverage Laravel's Eloquent relationships to simplify and clean up the code. For example, replace manual find and with statements with Eloquent relationships.

Error Handling:
Implement proper error handling instead of returning arrays with error messages. Consider using exceptions for better error handling.

Consistent Naming:
Maintain consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and class names. Follow the PSR-12 coding standards for PHP.

Replace Hardcoded URLs:
Instead of hardcoding URLs, use Laravel's URL generation methods, such as route().

Logging and Debugging:
Consider using Laravel's logging facilities, such as the Log facade, to handle logging more efficiently.

Optimize Database Queries:
Review the database queries for possible optimizations. Avoid using the get method unnecessarily when you can directly return Eloquent relationships.

Separation of Concerns:
Ensure that each class and method has a single responsibility. If a class or method is doing too much, consider refactoring.

Unit Testing:
Write unit tests for critical parts of your code. This helps ensure that changes do not introduce regressions.

Use Laravel Features:
Explore and leverage Laravel features such as events, notifications, and Laravel Mix for asset compilation.

Security:
Sanitize and validate user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.

################WHAT MAKES IT TERRIBLE CODE:-######################

Lack of Dependency Injection:
The constructor of BookingRepository class directly creates a new instance of the Logger class and does not use dependency injection for the MailerInterface. This makes the class tightly coupled and hard to test.

Hardcoded Environment Check:
The environment check for setting the OneSignal App ID and Rest API key is hardcoded. It's generally better to use configuration files or environment variables for such configurations.

Inconsistent Variable Naming:
Variable names are inconsistent and not following a standard. For example, $user_id and $userId are used interchangeably.

Lack of Exception Handling:
There is no exception handling in the code. If an error occurs during the execution of the code, it may result in unhandled exceptions.

Direct Database Queries:
There are direct database queries inside the methods (getUsersJobs, getUsersJobsHistory, store, etc.). It's recommended to use Eloquent relationships and queries for better readability and maintainability.

Incomplete Error Handling:
Error handling is not comprehensive. For example, there are checks for the existence of certain keys in the $data array, but there is no clear indication of what should happen if those conditions are not met.

Large Methods:
Some methods, such as getUsersJobs and getUsersJobsHistory, are quite large and handle multiple responsibilities. It's generally better to have smaller methods with a single responsibility.

Global Function Calls:
Calls to global functions, like date, env, and TeHelper::, make the code less modular and harder to test.

Lack of PHP Docblocks:
The code lacks proper PHPDoc comments, making it less clear how each method is intended to be used.

Unused Variables:
There are unused variables in the code, such as $pagenum in getUsersJobsHistory.

Incomplete Code:
Some parts of the code are commented out (//Event::fire(new JobWasCreated($job, $data, '*'));). It's unclear if this is intentional or if there are missing parts.

Security Considerations:
The code seems to be using user input directly without proper validation or sanitization, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
